# Lab 6 -- Binary Trees

Due by XXX on XXX

In this lab you will implement a recursive binary tree structure and
associated methods. After this lab you should be able to:
- implement binary trees;
- use recursion with datastructures;
- use stacks; and
- work with a Java graphical application.

We provide you with the following files, which you will *not* need to change:
- `TreeApp.java`
- `TreeAppFrame.java`
- `TreeDisplay.java`
- `BinaryTree.java`

And the following files, which you will need to modify:
- `ConsTree.java`
- `EmptyTree.java`
- `TreeLoader.java`

You will also need to create the following file:
- `BinaryTreeTest.java`
