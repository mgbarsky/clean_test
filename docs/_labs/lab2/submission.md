# Lab 2 -- More Java Fun
## Submission

Look through your Java files and make sure you've included your name at the
top of all of them. If you know that there is a problem in one of your
programs, document that at the top. If you adhered to the honor code in this
assignment, add the following statement as a comment at the top of each Java
file you wrote:
> I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment.

Quit Eclipse, and then delete the `bin` and `numbers` directories.
(If you don't quit Eclipse first, it will keep regenerating your class
files when it autocompiles!)

Zip the `Lab2` directory and turn it in via Blackboard.
