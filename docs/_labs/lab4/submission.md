# Lab 4 -- Stacks and Queues: Simply A-Maze-ing!
## Submission

Create a plain text file called `README` that contains the following information:
- Your name(s)
- Any known problems or assumptions made in your classes or program.

You should be using Javadoc style comments in your programs. You don't need to
generate the HTML output, but you do need to be writing them.

Look through your programs and make sure you've included your name at the top
of all of them.

If you adhered to the honor code in this assignment, add the following
statement to your README file:
> I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment.

Quit Eclipse, and then delete the `bin` directory.
(If you don't quit Eclipse first, it will keep regenerating your class
files when it autocompiles!)

Zip the `Lab4` directory and turn it in via Blackboard.
